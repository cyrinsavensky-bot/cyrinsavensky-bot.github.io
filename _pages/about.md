I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer with a deep passion for designing the scalable, resilient architectures that power today’s digital world. As of 2026, I recognize that the cloud is no longer just about storage—it is the engine for AI and global innovation. I am committed to mastering this ecosystem, starting with a rigorous self-study curriculum focused on AWS fundamentals. My goal is to transition my  logical troubleshooting into a career dedicated to high-availability systems and automated cloud operations.

While I am at the beginning of my professional cloud journey, I have built a basic foundation in the core pillars of IT: Basic Linux administration, networking (TCP/IP, DNS), and security-first design. I am actively pursuing the  AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure AZ-900 certification to validate my understanding of global infrastructure, cloud economics, and shared responsibility models. I approach every new concept with a "FinOps" mindset, prioritizing cost-efficiency and security from day one. 

I am an agile and highly motivated learner who thrives on solving complex puzzles. I am looking for a Junior Cloud Engineer or Internship role where I can apply my dedication and foundational knowledge to real-world challenges. I bring a collaborative spirit and a clear communication style, ensuring that I can contribute effectively to a team while rapidly upskilling in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and AIOps; I am ready to build the future of the cloud, one service at a time.
